## ⚡ About 
A **software engineer** @ IDEMIA Singapore. 
<br><br>
I love fiddling around with software to see what kind of fun and amazing product I can create just from my little old laptop. So if you have any cool project ideas, just hit me up :)

## 💻 Programming Languages
I've tried and worked with a few programming languages but I'm most comfortable coding in Python, Golang, Java and Typescript.<br><br>
